# CIROH Cloud Terraform Configuration

This Terraform configuration is used to build and manage resources on the CIROH cloud, including an EC2 instance running a containerized model.

## Docker Build
To build the Dockerfile, run the following command:
```bash
docker buildx build -f /docker/Dockerfile --platform=linux/amd64 -t $CONTAINER_NAME .
```

## Terraform validate

- GitHub Actions will run Terraform validation every time a push or pull request is made to a branch - `main` and includes changes to the Terraform files in the terraform directory.

** Note that the terraform init command is also included in the workflow. This command initializes the Terraform working directory and downloads the necessary providers and modules. It is required before running terraform validate to ensure that all dependencies are available.

## Terraform Usage

To run the Terraform configuration, follow these steps:

1. Generate a plan file by running terraform plan -o plan.file.
2. Apply the plan file by running terraform apply plan.file and fill out the Terraform variables.
