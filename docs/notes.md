# Notes on a "NextGen Universal Package"

There's been some discussion in the community about the combinatorial effects of opening up the possibility to build ever-more-complicated systems while making it more difficult to resproduce results in the community, or to share results for integration into our collective understanding of the world. 

The first step to building that collective understanding is based on having the same interpretation and categorization of the data we have and will produce. 

Firstly there must be a heirarchical underestanding of how we represent data and configurations. Note that these aren't 1:1 with the data and configurations, these are for the heirarchical framing of how those are organized. 

The identified components are as follows:

- _Data_
    - Hydrofabric
      - Underlying physical understanding of the domain
    - Forcings
      - Input data over a temporal and spacial domain
- _Configuration_
    - Realization of model allocation
      - Models (version of BMI-compatible model)     
      - Model configurations

Each Instance of the combination of these things is hereafter called a RUN and the grouping of all the aforementioned items necessitates a standardized RUN CONFIG. 

A preliminary Specification for NextGen RUN CONFIGs has been proposed.
